# Munich eSports SpectateUI
UI to display both champ select and ingame information for league of legends

## Installation 
1. Do you have NodeJS installed? If you do not know what this is, assume no. You can check by running 'node -v' in cmd  
   -> No? run installNodeJS.bat and follow the instructions.  
   -> Yes? Continue  
2. run setup.bat

3. Add http://localhost:3000/?backend=ws://localhost:8999 to your champion select scene
4. Add http://localhost:3001/?backend=ws://localhost:8999 to your ingame scene


## Usage
1. run startup.bat
	-> 3 seperate windows should open. You should be able to ignore almost everything here
	
2. Change information on https://stream-api.munich-esports.de/ as nescesary. Please no not change information here when not actively streaming!

3. To stop simply close all 3 windows




## Side note 
NodeJS is a javascript development environment.   
Due to the nature of this tool it was not polished for ease of use  
Feel free to remove NodeJS if you dont not wish to stream again, though having it will not affect your computer negatively
